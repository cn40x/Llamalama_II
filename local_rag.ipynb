And why do some people freak out when they see “15 items or less” at the grocery store?\\n\\nIf you’re writing a paper, getting grammar right is really helpful. For one thing, it will protect you from gangs of Grammar Nazis. But more important, it’ll make you a better writer. Your readers will appreciate it, even if they aren’t conscious of why.\\n\\nThis guide will cover those pesky words that we all get confused about from time to time. It will show you the right word to use when you’re clacking away at the keyboard. And above all, it will make your writing clearer.\\n\\nJust One Small Caveat\\n\\nThe purpose of grammar is not to be 100%, absolutely correct. It’s to make your writing easier to understand. And there are few things in grammar where everyone agrees anyway. What’s more, grammar is constantly changing.\\n\\nWith that in mind, some of these rules skirt the official, unyielding rules of those who believe grammar to be prescriptive. Rather, they reflect how grammar is working today (for an example, check out data vs datum).\\n\\nAffect vs Effect\\n\\nIf you’re only going to learn just one rule from this cheatsheet, make it this one.\\n\\nUsing these words incorrectly is so common that it’s difficult to know what the right usage is when you read it, let alone how to write it. That’s true of effect/affect more than anything. Fortunately, we’ve got a shortcut for you.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\nIn general, “affect” is a verb that means to have an impact on something and “effect” is a noun, as in the effect of something on something else. However, just to confuse things, “effect” can also be a verb meaning to cause something to happen.\\n\\nAnd, to further complicate things, “affect” can be noun, but only very rarely — generally in psychology.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nAffect as verb\\n\\nThe boy was affected by the trauma he had witnessed.\\n\\nAffect as a noun\\n\\nThe experiment triggered a strong negative affect on the participants.\\n\\nEffect as a noun\\n\\nThe effect of the economic downturn was a depressed job market.\\n\\nEffect as a verb\\n\\nI hope to effect significant change at my organization in the coming years.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nGiven the variety of forms these particular words can take, you might still be confused. Fortunately, there’s a shortcut.\\n\\nAssume that if a verb makes sense, it’s probably going to be “affect.” And if it’s a noun, it’s probably going to be “effect.”\\n\\nIf you’re not sure, try switching in another noun and another verb to see if the sentence makes sense.\\n\\nTake, for example, the sentence, “The boy was streetcar by trauma he witnessed.” It doesn’t make any sense, since “streetcar” is a noun.\\n\\nBut take the sentence, “The boy was bamboozled by the trauma he witnessed.” It does make grammatical sense, because bamboozle is a verb.\\n\\nThe same goes for effect.\\n\\nConsider: “The streetcar of the economic downturn was a depressed job market.” Versus: “The bamboozle of the economic downturn was a depressed job market.”\\n\\nAs you can see, only “streetcar” sounds right.\\n\\nExcept vs Accept\\n\\nThese two are difficult because they’re similarly spelled homophones. But they have two very different meanings.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Except” means to exclude something or say “everything but this one thing.”\\n\\n“Accept” means to receive something or recognize an idea as true or correct.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nSince this single word can completely reverse the meaning of a sentence, it’s particularly problematic. For example, imagine the sentences:\\n\\nPeople usually accept facts of the argument. • People usually except facts of the argument.\\n\\nThe first means that the facts are generally agreed to be true or correct. The second means that the facts are generally ignored or excluded.\\n\\nwhat’s why getting it right is so important.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nFortunately, there is an easy way to remember:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to use “accept,” remember that it needs to be a-okay. If something is a-okay, then it can be accepted. If it’s not a-okay, then it’s probably going to be “except.”\\n\\nThat’s because “accept” is usually used to describe something positive, whereas “except” is usually describing something that doesn’t conform or is negative.\\n\\nLose vs Loose\\n\\nIn this case, the words don’t sound the same, but are spelled very similarly. If you get this wrong, you might look silly, but it is unlikely that your reader will be confused.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Lose” is a verb that means to not win, to experience a loss, or to misplace something.\\n\\n“Loose” is usually an adjective to mean not tightened down. However, it can also mean to release.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nWhen I play chess, I lose about half the time. • The screw was loose, so the table fell apart.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nA good way to remember this is the rhyme, “There’s a moose on the loose.”\\n\\nIf you’re spelling it with two Os, then it has to rhyme with “moose.” If you’re only spelling it with one, then you mean that you lost something.\\n\\nThey’re, Their, and There\\n\\nThis particular grammar rule gets a lot of discussion throughout popular culture. But the truth is, it’s not that hard to get this just right. And unlike a lot of “rules” on this list, their/there/they’re is one where there truly is no wiggle room. You’re either correct or not.\\n\\nFortunately, it’s easy to use the right one.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“They’re” is a contraction of “they are.”\\n\\n“Their” is the possessive form of “they.” It shows ownership of something.\\n\\n“There” is an adverb referring to a place or where something is. It points to where something is or is going.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThey’re wondering where the dog went. • Their dog ran into the cafe. • They found the dog when they went over there.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIf you want to know if you should be using “they’re” just switch out the word for “they are.” If it still makes sense, you’re good to go.\\n\\nFor “their” and “there,” try replacing the word with “our.” If it still makes sense, then you should “their.” If it doesn’t, then you need to use “there.” For example:\\n\\nOur dog ran into the cafe. — Their dog ran into the cafe. • They found the dog when they went over our. — They found the dog when they went over there.”\\n\\nThe first sentence makes sense but the second doesn’t. Thus, the first sentence uses “their” and the second uses “there.”\\n\\nTwo vs To vs Too\\n\\n“To,” in its various forms, is one of the most common words you’ll ever write. Knowing which “to” to use is critical.\\n\\nFortunately, the rules are easy to remember.\\n\\nThe Official Rules and Examples\\n\\n“Two” is the written version of the number 2: “An infinitive has two words.”\\n\\n“To” has two functions. First, it is used to show movement or direction: “Let’s go over to the library.”\\n\\nSecond, it is used to create infinitives, which are verbs that are not bound to a subject. For example: “Star Trek was a show meant to go boldly where no human had gone before.”\\n\\nThe word “too” has two functions as well. First, it can be used as an adverb meaning “also.” For example: “I went to the store too.”\\n\\n“Too” can also be used as a modifier meaning “excessive.” For example, “The water was too hot.”\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nGetting the right “to” is easy. First, unless you’re talking about the number 2, don’t use “two.”\\n\\nSecond, “too” will very often go at the end of a sentence: “We went to the library too.” If it’s mid-sentence, however, and you’re not sure, substitute the word with “very” or “also.” If it makes sense with either, use “too.”\\n\\nFinally, if in doubt, use “to.” This is by far the most common one that you’ll use, so if you’re really not sure, this is your best guess.\\n\\nData vs datum\\n\\nYes, there is an actual rule here. However, it’s worth noting that, like many other words, data is used incorrectly so often it’s unlikely to have any impact on readability or comprehension.\\n\\nIf you simply use what you think sounds best, 99% of the time that’s going to be absolutely fine.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re writing something academic, talking about primary research, or just want to get it 100% right, then here’s how you can know when to use data and when to use datum.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Data” is a Latin-based word and is the plural of “datum.”\\n\\n“Datum” is the singular version of “data.”\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe data show that the hypothesis was correct. • One outlying datum point is fairly standard to see in experiments.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIn general, you should always use “data.” Using “datum” will make you sound pedantic and pretentious. What’s more, it will confuse many of your readers.\\n\\nThe only time you should use “datum” is if you are writing for a publication that uses it. Thus, you might use “datum” in a scientific paper. But even in this context, it is getting increasingly rare.\\n\\nGiven this, the examples above should be changed to:\\n\\nThe data show that the hypothesis was correct. • One outlying data point is fairly standard to see in experiments.\\n\\nNote: if anyone ever gives you any guff about “datum,” ask them what they think of the word “media” as in all the newspapers, magazines, and television shows. It is almost always treated as being singular. For example: “The media is biased!” But if someone insists that you say “datum point,” you can insist they say “media are.”\\n\\nQuote vs Quotation\\n\\nThis is an easy one to get right. But it’s worth noting that, like so many things in language, the incorrect version is used so often now that it’s rarely seen as an error.\\n\\nThus, it’s not essential to get this one right. But if you want to keep your writing clean and clear, it helps to be correct.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Quote” is a verb. “Quotation” is a noun.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nTo quote Shakespeare, “Man delights not me.”\\n\\nOne of my favorite Shakespeare quotations is “Man delights not me.”\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe best way to know if you’re right is to switch the word for “goat.” If the sentence still makes sense, it’s “quotation.” If not, it’s “quote.” If you like rhyming couplets:\\n\\nIf it’s “goat” Don’t use “quote.”\\n\\nBreath vs Breathe\\n\\nThis is another quote/quotation situation. But unlike there where it doesn’t matter too much if you get it right, this distinction is important. You will look ignorant if you use the wrong word.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Breath” is a noun, meaning the air in your lungs. You can take a quick breath or you can hold your breath.\\n\\n“Breathe” is a verb. It’s the doing version of breath. You take breaths, but what you are doing is breathing.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nHe took a deep breath to steady his nerves. •\\n\\nIf you’re feeling stressed, remember to breathe through your nose.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIf you’re struggling to remember which one to use, here are two tricks to help you.\\n\\n1. Remember the extra “e” in “breathe” is for “exhale,” since that’s what you do when you “breathe.”\\n\\n2. Switch the word for the word “death.” If it still makes sense, then “breath” is the word you want. If it doesn’t, then it needs to be “breathe.” Here’s another rhyming couplet:\\n\\nIf it works with death It must be breath.\\n\\nIt’s vs Its\\n\\nEven experienced writers make this mistake. And there’s a good reason: it isn’t logical.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“It’s” is a contraction of “it is” or “it has.” “Its” (with no apostrophe) is the possessive form of “it” and is used as an attributive adjective. This means that it connects the adjective to the noun being described.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nIt’s very cold outside. • It’s been very cold outside. • • My cat destroyed its favorite toy.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nLike most contractions, expanding the word into its separate terms will tell you if you’re right or not. If you expand “it’s” into “it is” or “it has” and the sentence still makes sense, then using the apostrophe is correct.\\n\\nIf not, then you should drop the apostrophe and use “its.”\\n\\nYou’re vs Your\\n\\nYet another problem caused by apostrophes.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“You’re” is a contraction of “you are.” “Your” is the possessive version of you. It’s used mostly to show ownership of something, but it can be used for a few other things like an informal collective: “He’s your Average Joe.”\\n\\nThe possessive function is the most common, and where the most mistakes crop up.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nYour suit is really nice. • You’re suited well for this job.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nLike all contractions, the best way to know if you’re right is to simply expand the words out to you are. If the sentence says what you want, then it should be “you’re.” If it doesn’t then it should be your with no apostrophe.\\n\\nFor example, “You are suit is really nice” doesn’t make sense. But “You are suited well for this job” does.\\n\\nWho’s vs Whose\\n\\nOnce again, the apostrophe rears its ugly head. But as with It’s/Its and You’re/Your, it isn’t hard to figure out which one is right.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Who’s” is a contraction of “who is.” “Whose” is the possessive form of “who” or, more informally, “which.”\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nWho’s going to host the party? • Whose party are you going to? • Whose [Which] team are you supporting?\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe best way to make sure you’re using any contraction correctly is to separate out the words. If you can swap in “who is” for your word and it still makes sense, then you need the apostrophe. If it doesn’t then the answer is “whose.”\\n\\nWe’re vs Were\\n\\nAlthough these two words look similar and sound identical, they are very different.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“We’re” is short for “we are.”\\n\\n“Were” is the past version of the verb “to be.”\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nWe’re going to be movies. • Where were you last night? • Were you going to the game later?\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nLike all apostrophe problems involving contractions, simply read your sentence aloud with the un-contracted words. In this case, “we are.” For example, “We are going to the movies” makes sense. “Where we are you last night” does not.\\n\\nIf it makes sense when you un-contract, use we’re. If it doesn’t, then you need to use were.\\n\\nEach Other’s vs Each Others’\\n\\nThis is another funny apostrophe that seems to throw a lot of people off, but the fact is only one of these is right: “each other’s.”\\n\\nThe Official Rules and Example\\n\\nEach other’s is the possessive form of each. Since we generally add ‘s to nouns to make them possessive, we do that here.\\n\\nThe reason that it’s not “each others'” is because it would imply that “other” was a plural noun.\\n\\nFor example, “We held each other’s hands” is correct. “We held each others’ hands” is not.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe easiest way to remember this is to remember that “other” is singular. If you remember that, then you can’t go wrong.\\n\\nAlot vs A Lot\\n\\nSorry to all you “alot” fans out there, but there’s some bad news. “Alot” just isn’t a word. No major dictionary recognizes it. (Note: “allot” is a word!)\\n\\nSo the rule is easy. Never, ever use “alot.” It’s always “a lot.”\\n\\nThen vs Than\\n\\nThe difference between “then” and “than” is probably one of the most confusing issues commonly facing a writer. This is particularly true because each of these words has so many functions.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Then” is an adverb but can be used as an adjective. Normally, it’s used in some way related to time or process.\\n\\n“Than” is a conjunction used to compare two or more things.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nI was at the pool then.\\n\\n• First you add the eggs, then you add the sugar. • I like potatoes more than carrots.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIf you’re talking about something that happens in a series, you use “then.” If you’re not talking about a series like that, you probably mean “than.”\\n\\nAnother way to remember it is “than” is for making comparisons. Finally, you always have more “than” or less “than” someone else. Never more “then” someone else.\\n\\nEnsure vs insure\\n\\nYou might be surprised, but ensure and insure actually have subtly different meanings. And in some contexts, getting just the right word can be important.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Ensure” means to guarantee something will or won’t happen.\\n\\n“Insure” means to arrange for insurance for something or arrange protection against something.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nI ensure that my clients get the best service.\\n\\n• He insured his boat for $25,000.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nTo get the right word, just remember that insure relates to insurance.\\n\\nIf you’re not talking in some way about insurance, you probably mean “ensure.”\\n\\nPrinciple vs principal\\n\\nPrinciple or principal is always tricky because you probably don’t use these words all that often and they’re extremely similar. It makes it hard to remember the right one, and usually means you have to look it up every time you want to us it.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Principle” is straightforward. It’s a noun that means idea or rule. “Principal” is harder. It’s both an adjective and a noun, depending on how it’s used. As an adjective, it describes something of primary importance. And as a noun, it means the most important part of something.\\n\\n“Principal” also has special meaning in finance having to do with the amount of money borrowed or invested.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nOur organization is built on the principle of respect. • She is the principal architect of the project. •\\n\\nI bought a house for $100,000 with 30% down, so my principal is $70,000.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIf you’re talking about an idea or rule, it’s usually principle. If you’re talking about something being first or important, then it’s usually principal.\\n\\nIf in doubt, remember the sentence: “The head of the school is Principal Al.\\n\\nFewer vs Less\\n\\nDespite what grammar enthusiasts might think, language and grammar are not set in stone. And for some words, the rules and their use don’t match up very clearly at all. Fewer” and less” are two examples of this.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Fewer” is only for use when the things you’re referring to are countable. “Less” is for referring to things that are uncountable.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n•\\n\\nI have fewer bottles of waters. I have less water.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nIf you can count the thing you’re referring to, it should be “fewer.” If you can’t count it, it should be “less.” However, this is a distinction that few readers are even aware of. More important, confusing the two words never creates confusion.\\n\\nFarther vs Further\\n\\n“Farther” and “further” are often used interchangeably. Which is great! It means it’s much harder to be wrong. But using these words as intended will make your writing more exacting.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\nTechnically, there is very little difference between these words. “Further” can be used as a verb whereas “farther” cannot. For example: “They were furthering their careers by taking night classes.”\\n\\nOtherwise, they’re both used adverbs and adjectives to describe putting distance between two things.\\n\\nOfficially, there is no real rule on when to use one or the other, but generally “farther” relates to measurable distances and “further” relates to abstract distances. This is particularly true in American English.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n•\\n\\nI can throw the ball farther than you. I had gone further in my career than I ever expected.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe best way to remember which one to use is that you use “farther” for physical distances and “further” for metaphorical ones.\\n\\nGrammar Girl podcast creator Mignon Fogarty says the easiest way to remember this is that farther had far in it, which obviously relates to physical distance.\\n\\nLay vs Lie\\n\\n“Lay” and “lie” (not to be confused with lye) are two little, tiny, completely bewildering words. Here’s how you use them correctly every time.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Lay” is a verb that means to put something down carefully. It can usually be replaced with the verb “to place.” “Lie” is a verb that means to rest on a horizontal surface. It’s a synonym of “recline.”\\n\\nLay requires a direct object — you need something to lay down, like a brick. Lie has no such requirement — you don’t need a direct object to lie down. That’s why you can “lie down for a nap.” There’s no direct object, so we use “lie.”\\n\\nWhere is gets confusing is with the past tense. The past tense of lie is lay. Confused? Maybe this table will help:\\n\\nSimple Present Lie Lay\\n\\nPresent Participle Lying Laying\\n\\nSimple Past Lay Laid\\n\\nPast Participle Lain Laid\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nLay\\n\\nThey lay down the beach towels. • They are laying down the beach towels.\\n\\nThey laid down the beach towels. • They have laid down the beach towels.\\n\\nLie\\n\\nThey lie down for a nap. • They are lying down for a nap. • They lay down for a nap. • They have lain for a nap.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nA good way to remember which is which is the term, “Lay it on me.” “It” is the direct object, which is why it’s “Lay it on me,” and not “Lie it on me.”\\n\\nAnd whenever you’re not sure, just write out the six words above. Usually, when you write them all out, it becomes clear which one is right.\\n\\nDie vs Dye\\n\\nThis is another tricky one because of the similarities between die and dye in spelling and the fact that they’re homophones. Plus, they’re funny looking words.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Die” is both a verb meaning to become dead as well as a noun, as in the singular form of “dice” — the things people use for gambling and role playing games. “Dye” is both a noun and a verb and refers to coloring something and that something being colored.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nHe rolled the die and got a six. • Fred died from cancer last year. • She dyed her friend’s hair blue. • He used a red dye for his project.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe easiest way to remember whether to use “die” or “dye” is to think of the movie Die Hard. It’s about a rogue cop fighting off Hans Gruber at Christmas, not about a Scottish shepherd dying wool.\\n\\nDiscreet vs Discrete\\n\\nDiscreet and discrete, though they sound the same, actually have very different meanings. Here’s how to know when to use each one.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Discreet” is an adjective that means to unobtrusive, quiet, and careful to blend into the background. It can also mean to be cagey and obfuscate the true meaning of something.\\n\\n“Discrete,” on the other hand, means “a distinct and separate entity.” It’s often used in academic and scientific literature to describe data where each point is unrelated to the point before and after it. For example, flipping a coin creates a series of “discrete” events because the results of the first one don’t impact later coin flips.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nWhen I picked up the cake for the surprise party, the baker was mercifully discreet so as not to alert my wife.\\n\\nAn orchestra might sound like a single entity, but in reality it’s lots and lots of discrete sounds.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nGiven that “discreet” is used much more often in general writing than “discrete,” just memorize how “discreet” is spelled. When you run into a situation where you need to use the word “discrete,” just look it up.\\n\\nElicit vs Illicit\\n\\n“Elicit” and “illicit” are two words you do not want to confuse. You might end up in legal hot water if you do!\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Elicit” is a verb meaning to ask for help or assistance. Oftentimes, it’s used to describe asking for money or a donation.\\n\\n“Illicit,” on the other hand, means something is underhanded or illegal, like the illicit sales of drugs or the illicit use of software for music piracy.\\n\\nYou can see why you don’t want to mix the two up!\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe President called to elicit donations to support the campaign. • There’s a rising tide of illicit economic activity in our cities.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\n“Illicit” is obviously derived from the same word as “illegal.” So that isn’t hard to remember. “Elicit” comes from the Latin word elicere, which means to produce as if by magic, like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. But mostly, you will know you want to use the word “elicit” because what is being done is not illegal.\\n\\nPrecede vs Proceed\\n\\n“Precede” and “proceed” are uniquely frustrating for writers because not only do they sound the same, but they mean broadly the same things — go forward. However, their more nuanced meanings are quite different, so it’s worth knowing when to use one over the other.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Precede” is a verb that means to happen before something else or be in front of something in an order or process.\\n\\n“Proceed,” on the other hand, means to go forward, usually after an interruption. The idea is that whatever action or thing you’re talking about is part of a process that’s already in motion, rather than an action or thing that happens before a process starts.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe eggs usually precede the flour when you’re making cookies. • The cook proceeded despite not having any eggs, and the cookies were terrible.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nPre- usually means “come before.” Prenuptial agreements come before marriage, pre-K comes before kindergarten, pre-order means order before the product comes out.\\n\\nThe same goes for the pre- in “precede.” If you’re using precedes, you’re talking about something that comes before something else.\\n\\nA vs An\\n\\nWord processors are usually good at picking up this particular error, but it’s still good to know when to use “a” and when to use “an.”\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“A” and “an” are indefinite articles that tell the reader the noun that’s being talked about is generic, not specific. For example, “I saw a movie about a boat.” Compare that to, “I saw the movie Titanic about the boat Titanic.”\\n\\nOddly, in English, for indefinite articles, it’s the sound that’s important to whether you use “a” or “an.” “An” is used when the next word starts with a vowel, or makes a vowel sound. “A” is used the rest of the time.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n• •\\n\\nI want to get a snickers bar. I want to get an ice cream cone. I went to the cafe for an hour. (Note that even though “hour” doesn’t start with a vowel, the sound of the word does, so it is preceded by “an” rather than “a.”)\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe rules here are easy. Keep vowels separate! If you’re not sure, read the sentence out loud and listen to how it sounds. Most of the time, what sounds right is what will be right.\\n\\nThere is still some disagreement about words like “historical.” As far back as Fowler’s Modern English Usage (1926), the advice has been to use “a” if you aspirate the “h.” Since virtually no one says “‘Istorical” today, you should use “a historical” and not “an historical.” When speaking, this is obviously true. Saying “an historical” makes the speaker look paradoxically ignorant and pretentious.\\n\\nAdvice vs Advise\\n\\n“Advice” and “advise” are often used interchangeably, but in fact carry two distinctly different meanings.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Advice” is a noun meaning “guidance or recommendations.” “Advise” is the verb meaning to provide advice.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n•\\n\\nI would like some advice on how best to write a blog. I advised my friend on how to shop for backpacks.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe easiest way to remember this distinction is to read the words aloud. The “s” in “advise” is pronounced with a “z” sound and is clearly the verb. “Advice” sounds just like it is spelled and is clearly the noun.\\n\\nCompliment vs Complement\\n\\nThese two words are particularly easy to confuse because they look and sound similar and have similar meanings. However, they do actually mean different things.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Compliment” is a noun and a verb meaning praise (noun) or to praise (verb). “Complement” is a noun and a verb meaning to enhanced or to be made so.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nMy compliments to the chef! The green beans complemented the steak beautifully.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe best way to keep these straight is to remember that if something “complements” something, it “completes” it.\\n\\nLatter vs ladder\\n\\nThis is one of those pesky little grammar confusions that, unfortunately, will make you look like a dingus if you get it wrong. On the plus side, there’s a very easy trick to getting it right every single time.\\n\\nThe Official Rules and Examples\\n\\n“Latter” refers to something that happened towards the end of something, like the latter (second) half of the movie. Usually, it means the second thing to happen of two, but it can be used to mean the last of a series.\\n\\nMost frequently, it’s used in the term the former and the latter, as in:\\n\\nThe professor made two arguments. The former was convincing, but the latter was not.\\n\\n“Ladder” is a noun, which refers to the thing that you climb onto roofs with. Think of “stepladder” or a “frame ladder.”\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\n“Latter” refers to the end of something or the second of a comparison. You can remember this because it is similar to “late.” You can remember “ladder” just because it isn’t “latter.”\\n\\nLead vs Led\\n\\nThis is a classic mistake. There are a few reasons why this is so. For one thing, the similarly structured word “read” does not change to “red” for its past tense. Equally vexing is that “led” is pronounced the same way the element “lead” is.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Lead” is a verb meaning to be in charge of something else. And as we just mentioned, it is also a metal that is pronounced “led.”\\n\\n“Led” is the past tense of lead.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nI like to lead my team to victory. • • Last night, I led my team to victory. • Lead is extremely toxic, especial to children.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nThe best way to remember that led is the past tense of lead is to remember these rhyming couplets:\\n\\nIn present tense, you lead the way But once you’re done, you drop the “a.”\\n\\nAisle vs Isle\\n\\nThese two funny looking words cause no end of confusion. Here’s how you get them right.\\n\\nThe Official Rules and Examples\\n\\n“Aisle” is a noun meaning a narrow passage through something. For example, “The store was so crowded it was hard to get through the toy aisle.”\\n\\n“Isle,” on the other hand, is a term for a small island, and is often made plural (“isles”) to describe a chain of small islands. For example, “The Isle of Man is a small island in the Irish Sea.”\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nRemember that “isle” and “island” look the same, and you’ll never be browsing the “isles” again.\\n\\nStationery vs Stationary\\n\\nThese words are asymmetric. Writing “stationery” for “stationary” would likely look bad. Most people wouldn’t notice if you wrote “stationary” for “stationery,” however.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Stationary” is an adjective meaning fixed or not moving. It can also mean stable or unchanging.\\n\\n“Stationery” refers to the stuff on your desk — pens, papers, envelopes, and other generic office material. In particular, it’s often used to mean paper that has matching envelops.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe truck was idling at the light, completely stationary. • Wilson had some beautiful stationery on his desk.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nMost people know the word “stationary,” which is why “stationery” is so often misspelled “stationary.” All you really have to remember is that “stationery” is not “stationary.” Then you can look it up, or just remember that it has that odd “e” where the “a” ought to go.\\n\\nPoor vs Pore vs Pour\\n\\nSo many options. Which poor to use?\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Poor” is an adjective meaning to be without. Usually it refers to money (“alms for the poor”) but can also be combined with other words to reference being without something other than cash (eg, “time poor”).\\n\\n“Pore” is both a noun meaning a tiny hole in a surface (using skin) and a verb, meaning to look something over extremely carefully and with great interest.\\n\\nFinally, “pour” is a verb meaning to move liquid in the form of a stream.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nPoor people often can’t cover basic expenses. • • If your pores get clogged, it can lead to infection. It poured with rain all weekend.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nMost people have no trouble with “poor” and “pour.” They are common words that we all use a lot. “Pore,” however, it a bit of a pain. You can associate “pore” with “bore.” That makes sense because pores are like holes that have been bored” in a surface. The other definition of “pore,” is harder. But it is also the least used. Like so many words, the key is knowing that there is something to know. And remembering that “looking something over carefully” has a word that sounds like “poor” should be all you need to remember that it is spelled “pore.”\\n\\nIllusion vs Allusion\\n\\n“Illusion” and “allusion” look so similar that it’s no wonder that people find them so confusing.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Illusion” is a fake or mistaken belief or a deliberate effort to hide or cover up the truth.\\n\\n“Allusion” is an often subtle reference to something else, like an “allusion” to a past book an author wrote or an “allusion” to a shared experience.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe magician presented the illusion of a ball floating in the air. • The hat sequence in Waiting for Godot is an allusion to Charlie Chaplin.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nAn “illusion” is something that is illustrated. An allusion is something that is alluding to something else.\\n\\nAlley vs ally\\n\\n“Alley” and “ally” do sound different which means they’re never confused when spoken. But when you’re writing, it’s a whole different story.\\n\\nThe Official Rules\\n\\n“Alley” is a narrow passage, often between tall buildings. “Ally” is someone or something who has a positive relationship or agreement with you.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nThe alley behind the restaurant was always creepy at night. •\\n\\nIn WWII, the UK, US, and USSR were allies against Germany and Japan.\\n\\nRules of Thumb\\n\\nAll you need to do is picture an old Greek or Roman galley with a single narrow path between all the rowers and remember: galleys have alleys.\\n\\nYou can also remember that the two words are spelled just about the opposite of what you would expect. For example, “alley” sounds like it ends with -ly, but doesn’t. And “ally” does end with - ly, but doesn’t sound like that at all.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAs you start to expand your blog and explore writing more, you’ll discover that grammar is more of a loose set of guideline than an absolute authority.\\n\\nAnd this isn’t a bad thing.\\n\\nIn fact, its dynamism is exactly what makes language so incredible. It’s the reason that we can add words like “quiz,” “selfie,” “computer,” “sticky-outy,” and “bug-eyed” to the Oxford English Dictionary. As humans, we’re always inventing new stuff, and we need words to describe it.\\n\\nOne thing to watch out for is over-reliance on your computer. This article is filled with words that you computer will not have a problem with. If you write, “The Alleys won the Second World War,” your computer won’t have any problem with it. (It might amuse your reader, but not in a way you want.) So you have to take responsibility for what you write.\\n\\nOne step in doing that is to bookmark this cheatsheet. It really is handy. You can always avoid embarrassing yourself by searching Google, but most of your questions are answered right here.\\n\\nThe main thing is to concentrate of writing well. Don’t let the story you’re trying to tell get destroyed by obsessing over grammar details. Just the same, you don’t want bad grammar to destroy the story you are trying to tell. It’s a balancing act.\\n\\nHave fun blogging!\")]\n",

      "[Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/kunkerdthaisong/Llamalama_II/human_body_parts_organsb2.pdf'}, page_content=\"Human body parts and organs (B2)\\n\\nIt goes without saying that humans (mammals identifiable as those that stand upright and are comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have pretty remarkable bodies, given all that they've accomplished. (Furthermore, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) To be sure, humans have overcome predators, disease, and all sorts of other obstacles over thousands of years.\\n\\nTo fully understand and appreciate these accomplishments, let's take at some of the most well-known parts of the human body!\\n\\nThe head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body, has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.\\n\\nThe eyes make way for the nose, or an external (sticking-out) organ that plays an important part in the breathing and bacteria-elimination processes. Below that is the mouth, or a wide, cavernous organ that chews food, removes bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, or small, white-colored, pointed body parts used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red-colored, boneless organ used to chew food and speak.\\n\\nThe neck is the long body part that connects the head to the chest (the muscular body part that protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and liquid-processing organs, comes below that.\\n\\nThe legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.\\n\\nArms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.\\n\\nThe aforementioned shoulders are rounded body parts that aid arms' flexibility. One's back is found on the opposite side of the stomach, and is a flat section of the body that contains important muscles that're intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping humans perform certain motions and actions.\\n\\nDid you understand the text?\\n\\n1/2\\n\\nDid you understand the text?\\n\\n1) Which of the following body parts is not located on the head or face?\\n\\na)\\n\\nEye\\n\\nb)\\n\\nNose\\n\\nc)\\n\\nMouth\\n\\nd)\\n\\nLeg\\n\\n2) Legs are comprised of which of the following?\\n\\na)\\n\\nFeet\\n\\nb)\\n\\nCalves\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThighs\\n\\nd)\\n\\nAll of the above\\n\\n3) How many toes and fingers are on each foot/hand?\\n\\na)\\n\\nTen\\n\\nb)\\n\\nFive\\n\\nc)\\n\\nFour\\n\\nd)\\n\\nTwo\\n\\n4) The part of the body that contains important organs that aid digestion is:\\n\\na)\\n\\nThe back\\n\\nb)\\n\\nThe head\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThe stomach\\n\\nd)\\n\\nThe neck\\n\\n5) Which of the following is not a body part/organ on the human body?\\n\\na)\\n\\nQuilt\\n\\nb)\\n\\nNeck\\n\\nc)\\n\\nHead\\n\\nd)\\n\\nArm\\n\\nSource: https://lingua.com/english/reading/body-parts/ Solution: 1) d 2) d 3) b 4) c 5) a\\n\\n2/2\")]\n",

This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention. A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a visit to many popular cities worldwide. Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments.

      "[Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/kunkerdthaisong/Llamalama_II/environmentc1.pdf'}, page_content='The Environment (C1)\\n\\nIn our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth in danger.\\n\\nGlobal warming or climate change is a major contributing factor to environmental damage. Because of global warming, we have seen an increase in melting ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and the formation of new weather patterns. These weather patterns have caused stronger storms, droughts, and flooding in places that they formerly did not occur.\\n\\nAir pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.\\n\\nIn many areas, people and local governments do not sustainably use their natural resources. Mining for natural gases, deforestation, and even improper use of water resources can have tremendous effects on the environment.

It killed about 20 to 50 million people worldwide, perhaps more. The total death toll is unknown because medical records were not kept in many areas.\\n\\nThe pandemic hit during World War I and devastated military troops. In the United States, for instance, more servicemen were killed from the flu than from the war itself. The Spanish flu was fatal to a higher proportion of young adults than most flu viruses.\\n\\nThe pandemic started mildly, in the spring of 1918, but was followed by a much more severe wave in the fall of 1918. The war likely contributed to the devastating mortality numbers, as large outbreaks occurred in military forces living in close quarters. Poor nutrition and the unsanitary conditions of war camps had an effect.\\n\\nA third wave occurred in the winter and spring of 1919, and a fourth, smaller wave occurred in a few areas in spring 1920. Initial symptoms of the flu were typical: sore throat, headache, and fever. The flu often progressed rapidly to cause severe pneumonia and sometimes hemorrhage in the lungs and mucus membranes. A characteristic feature of severe cases of the Spanish Flu was heliotrope cyanosis, where the patient's face turned blue from lack of oxygen in the cells. Death usually followed within hours or days.\\n\\nModern medicine such as vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary infections were not available at that time, so medical personnel couldn't do much more than try to relieve symptoms.\\n\\nThe flu ended when it had infected enough people that those who were susceptible had either died or developed immunity.\\n\\nDid you understand the text?\\n\\n1) Which pandemic is the deadliest in modern history?\\n\\na)\\n\\nThe bubonic plague in the 14th century\\n\\nb)\\n\\nThe Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic in 1793\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThe Spanish Flu in 1918\\n\\nd)\\n\\nThe Covid-19 coronavirus in 2020\\n\\n2) The Spanish Flu pandemic occurred during which war?\\n\\na)\\n\\nThe French Revolution\\n\\nb)\\n\\nThe Spanish-American War\\n\\nc)\\n\\nWorld War I\\n\\nd)\\n\\nWorld War II\\n\\n3) Where did the Spanish flu originate?\\n\\na)\\n\\nSpain\\n\\nb)\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nc)\\n\\nItaly\\n\\nd)\\n\\nThat information is not provided\\n\\n1/2\\n\\nMore questions about the text:\\n\\n4) Why are total deaths for the Spanish Flu not known?\\n\\na)\\n\\nNo one cared because of the war\\n\\nb)\\n\\nMany areas did not keep medical records\\n\\nc)\\n\\nMost medical records were destroyed in the war\\n\\nd)\\n\\nNo one wants to know how bad it was\\n\\n5) When was the first wave of the Spanish Flu pandemic?\\n\\na)\\n\\nSpring 1918\\n\\nb)\\n\\nSummer 1918\\n\\nc)\\n\\nFall 1918\\n\\nd)\\n\\nWinter 1918\\n\\n6) What contributed to deaths from the flu in military personnel?\\n\\na)\\n\\nClose quarters\\n\\nb)\\n\\nPoor nutrition\\n\\nc)\\n\\nUnsanitary conditions\\n\\nd)\\n\\nAll of the above\\n\\n7) What is a characteristic feature of serious cases of the Spanish Flu?\\n\\na)\\n\\nComa\\n\\nb)\\n\\nFace turning blue\\n\\nc)\\n\\nLiver failure\\n\\nd)\\n\\nExtremely high fever\\n\\n8) What caused the Spanish Flu pandemic to end?\\n\\na)\\n\\nThey created a vaccine for it\\n\\nb)\\n\\nImproved medical care\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThe end of the war caused better conditions\\n\\nd)\\n\\nThose who were susceptible had either died or were immune\\n\\nSource: https://lingua.com/english/reading/spanish-flu-pandemic-of-1918/ Solution: 1) c 2) c 3) d 4) b 5) a 6) d 7) b 8) d\\n\\n2/2\")]\n"
